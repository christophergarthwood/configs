To ensure the user list is disabled, run the following command:

$ gconftool-2 --direct \
--config-source xml:readwrite:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory \
--get /apps/gdm/simple-greeter/disable_user_list

The output should be "true". If it is not, this is a finding. 

Fix Text: 
In the default graphical environment, users logging directly into the system are greeted with a login screen that displays all known users. This functionality should be disabled.

Run the following command to disable the user list:

$ sudo gconftool-2 --direct \
--config-source xml:readwrite:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory \
--type bool --set /apps/gdm/simple-greeter/disable_user_list true
