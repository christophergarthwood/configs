        Use with :Neomake on shell scripts with ShellCheck in the path.
	VIMRC PLACEMENT
		In Vim, your home directory is specified with $HOME. On Unix systems, this is your ~ directory. On Windows systems, the best way to find the value of $HOME is from within Vim, as follows. These commands are useful to see what directories your Vim is using:
		:version
		:echo expand('~')
		:echo $HOME
		:echo $VIM
		:echo $VIMRUNTIME

		Once you determine the HOME variable put the vimrc file within that directory.
		If you would like to change your HOME variable, set HOME as an environment variable for either the system or user.
		Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Advanced > Environment Variables > User | System Variables.
		Windows (both Native and Cygwin*) will use _gvimrc, .gvimrc, _vimrc and .vimrc in that order of priority. The gvim* files will be checked with the gvim process, while the console vim will only check the vim* files.

X WINDOW
	startx -- :1 -bpp 24 vt8
	xeyes -display :1

	Run Multiple X Sessions Simultaneously
	On most PCs, you can start more than one X session and switch between them with Ctrl-Alt-F7 and Ctrl-Alt-F8, for example. Why would you do this? Well, some X applications don't really need a full-blown window manager gobbling up your precious RAM and CPU. For example, VMware Workstation and Stellarium are two applications that I use (rarely simultaneously, by the way) that don't need anything but a display. I don't need cut and paste with Stellarium, and VMware is basically a display manager in itself. In addition, just playing with X in this way makes you understand the interrelationships between X, your window manager and your applications. 

	Start your X engine (aka implicit xinit). You probably just use startx, and it reads your .xinitrc file and, doing what it's told, thereby launches X on the first available console, complete with window manager. This is probably display :0. 

	Start your X2 engine (aka explicit xinit). From a terminal, you can launch another X server on your machine:

	xinit /opt/vmware/workstation/bin/vmware
	 ?-display :1 -- :1 &
	The first argument taken by xinit is the path for the client that will be launched. It must be an absolute path starting at /. Everything after the -- is passed to the X server. Read the xinit(1) man page a bit for more fine examples. 

	Fire off your local X server:
	xinit /usr/bin/xterm -- :1 &
	This yields a vanilla X session with merely an xterm runningno window manager. Now, you need to add permissions to this window session for the remote host. You can tunnel the connection through SSH if your network is insecure, but there's a distinct performance hit. If your network is secure, you can simply do xhost +remotehost and spray directly to your X server. 

	For tunneled SSH: 
	ssh -fY remotehost /usr/bin/wmaker
	For spray directly:
	xhost +remotehost
	ssh -f remotehost /usr/bin/wmaker
	 ?-display localmachine:1
	The first option, if your remote SSH server supports it, uses a locally defined DISPLAY that then gets tunneled to your local side over SSH. The second option allows remotehost to send X data directly to your local display, then runs Window Maker there but displays it locally. Now, all your desktop actions are done on the remote machine, not locally.

BASH VARIABLES
Reference:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/673055/correct-bash-and-shell-script-variable-capitalization/42290320#42290320
Use all caps and underscores for exported variables and constants. Use a common prefix whenever applicable so that related variables stand out.
  Examples:
  Exported variables with a common prefix: JOB_HOME JOB_LOG JOB_TEMP JOB_RUN_CONTROL
  Constants: PI MAX_FILES OK ERROR WARNING

Use "snake case" (all lowercase and underscores) for all variables that are scoped to a single script or a block.
  Examples: input_file first_value max_amount num_errors

Mixed case when local variable has some relationship with an environment variable, like: old_IFS old_HOME

Use a leading underscore for "private" variables and functions. This is especially relevant if you ever write a shell library where functions within a library file or across files need to share variables, without ever clashing with anything that might be similarly named in the main code.
  Examples: _debug _debug_level _current_log_file

Never use camel case. This will make sure we don't run into bugs caused by case typos.
  Examples: inputArray thisLooksBAD, numRecordsProcessed, veryInconsistent_style

BASH BEST PRACTICES
#let script exit if a command fails
set -o errexit 
OR
set -e
#let script exit if an unsed variable is used
set -o nounset
OR
set -u
#use = for string comparisons
#use $(command) instead of backticks
#double quote "${my_var}" variables and curly brace for local vars
#add || true to commands that allow you to fail
#set xtrace to for debugging
set -o xtrace
OR
set -x
#!/usr/bin/env bash is more portable then #!/bin/bash
Use :- if you want to test variables that could be undeclared. For instance: if [ "${NAME:-}" = "Kevin" ] will set $NAME to be empty if it's not declared. You can also set it to noname like so if [ "${NAME:-noname}" = "Kevin" ]

GIT SSL ISSUES

http.slCAPath or http.sslCAInfo. Adam Spiers's answer gives some great examples. This is the most secure solution to the question.
To disable TLS/SSL verification for a single git command

try passing -c to git with the proper config variable, or use Flow's answer:

git -c http.sslVerify=false clone https://example.com/path/to/git

To disable SSL verification for a specific repository

If the repository is completely under your control, you can try:

git config http.sslVerify false

There are quite a few SSL configuration options in git. From the man page of git config:
http.sslVerify
Whether to verify the SSL certificate when fetching or pushing over HTTPS.
Can be overridden by the GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY environment variable.

http.sslCAInfo
File containing the certificates to verify the peer with when fetching or pushing
over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the GIT_SSL_CAINFO environment variable.

http.sslCAPath
Path containing files with the CA certificates to verify the peer with when
fetching or pushing over HTTPS.
Can be overridden by the GIT_SSL_CAPATH environment variable.

A few other useful SSL configuration options:

http.sslCert
File containing the SSL certificate when fetching or pushing over HTTPS.
Can be overridden by the GIT_SSL_CERT environment variable.

http.sslKey
File containing the SSL private key when fetching or pushing over HTTPS.
Can be overridden by the GIT_SSL_KEY environment variable.

http.sslCertPasswordProtected
Enable git's password prompt for the SSL certificate. Otherwise OpenSSL will
prompt the user, possibly many times, if the certificate or private key is encrypted.
Can be overridden by the GIT_SSL_CERT_PASSWORD_PROTECTED environment variable.

PROCESS CONTROL
To start a new process which should execute only in one core, you can use taskset command.

taskset -c 0 executable

To monitor the existing process's CPU affinity, you can use this command:

taskset -cp $(pgrep -f executable)

note that the executable identity you will pass to this command can be './executable' if you started it that way.
