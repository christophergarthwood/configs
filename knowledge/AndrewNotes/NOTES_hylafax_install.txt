
cd /usr/prots/comms/hylafax
make install

cd /usr/ports/print/ghostscript6/
make install

Don't forget to run faxmodem(1M) (if you have a send-only environment)
or configure init to run faxgetty on ttyd0.

 I run HylaFAX on 4.2-STABLE and those files are for Linux.
 Once you've installed Hylafax and run faxaddmodem, you need to make sure that: 
  
 o You edit /etc/ttys to setup faxgetty to listen on a tty and you do that by adding these lines. 
  
 #Necessary for HYLAFAX modem setup
 cuaa0  "/usr/local/sbin/faxmodem"
 cuaa0  "/usr/local/sbin/faxgetty"      dialup  on 
  
 If your modem is on COM2 , change cuaa0 to cuaa1
  
 Next make sure HylaFAX is started at system startup time:
  
 o cd /usr/local/etc/rc.d
 mv hylafax.sh.sample hylafax.sh
 chmod +x hylafax.sh
  
 Of course I am assuming that your config.cuaaX (where X=0,1 depending on your COM port) is already configured.
  
 The rest that you see on that page is Linux-centric stuff.
  
 I use Hylafax mostly for sendout for www.tpc.int
  
 maybe you should look at www.cybercomm.nl/~hylafax/setup.html and read through /~hylafax/setup-advanced.html
