
For advanced debugging such as memory leaks, kmtrace (in
                               kdesdk) seems to do a good job too. What was missing for a long time was a memory debugger, to detect use of
                               uninitialized or deleted memory etc., such as Purify provides. This is now available thanks to Julian Seward, who
                               developed a GPL tool call valgrind. 

                               Although still under development, this tool allows to find many non-obvious bugs in the code. But for the most common
                               types of bugs (wrong code paths etc.) kdDebug() (the equivalent of printf or cout) and gdb do the job quite well ;)
