InterMezzo is a classic client-server application.
InterMezzo includes a
loadable kernel module, which is notified of all updates to directories
and files. These updates are written into a journal log file.
don't use 2.4.15, it has a
serious bug that might end up destroying your partitions

create /etc/intermezzo/ as root on the server and client.
In that directory I edited a file called "sysid," inserting a
single line that contains important information for InterMezzo
(including the name of the system, the name of the device used for
InterMezzo, and the system's IP address). 

Then in another file in that directory, "serverdb", I put the key/value
pairs for each InterMezzo file server: 

{
       InterMezzo => {
          ipaddr => "10.100.255.254"
                                 }
};


In the third and last file in /etc/intermezzo/, "voldb", I put a another
key/value pair - similar to the serverdb file - to define servers and
clients that replicate files and directories from the InterMezzo file
server. In my case, the file looked like this: 

{   shared => {
       servername => "InterMezzo",
       replicators =>     [ "T21" ]
                       }
};


Then, on my T21 laptop, I created an ext2 filesystem to hold
InterMezzo on my /home/moshe partition with mke2fs /dev/hdb7.
You could also use a loop-back device or a plain file for that
purpose, but I guess using a full partition makes everything a bit
easier and faster. After formatting my partition with ext2, I mounted
it. 

In order to use InterMezzo for that filesystem, you have to start the
cache manager with "lento.pl", which is part of the InterMezzo
user-space utilities and is written in Perl. In other words, you do
need Perl to use InterMezzo, unless you rewrite the user-space
utilities in some other language. Doing a simple cd to /home/moshe
and an ls now showed the files exported from the Qube.
