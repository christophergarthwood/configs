I think I have disk quota figured out.  I want to clear up two things...

1) If I set a group quota for a mount point, is it cumulative for the group
for per user.

i.e. I setup 20 users in the group 'foo'
I edit fstab so /home has a quota and then 'edquota -q foo' and set the hard
limit to 5120 blocks (5-Megs[correct?]).  I'm assuming that a block is
1024-bytes, not the older 512-bytes.
Will quota only allow 5-Megs total for those users in group 'foo' (under
mount point /home) or 5-Megs per user assigned to group 'foo'?
What happens if 'foo' is not a user's primary group but they are setup in
/etc/group so that 'foo' is a secondary group?

2) Is there a substantial performance hit for quota.

The mind reels at the possibilities!

Okay I'm going to answer my own questions here (found the
/usr/share/doc/smm/04.quotoas)

Group permission are cumulative for all users!
To give each user a quota you should create a template and then you can
"copy" quota information for each user from the template user.
i.e. 'foobar' has been setup with permissions, 'goobar' hasen't.  So...
'edquota -u -p foobar goobar'
will copy foobar's limit levels to goobar.

BTW quota blocks are 1K in size.

As for CPU load(from 04.quotas):
"Measurements have shown that the quota code uses a very small percentage of
the system cpu time consumed in writing a new block to disc."

Now new question: edquota can add quota for a user or group, but what
happens if the user is removed?  How do I remove the non-existent user's
information form the quota file(s)?  It seems to me that on large user
systems these files could accumulate a lot of dead space.
