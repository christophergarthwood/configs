Netatalk supplies two different types of AFP servers and both can run at
the same time. Classic AFP over AppleTalk requires afpd and atalkd. AFP
over IP only requires afpd.

Add the following lines to your /etc/services file:

rtmp            1/ddp           # Routing Table Maintenance Protocol
nbp             2/ddp           # Name Binding Protocol
echo            4/ddp           # AppleTalk Echo Protocol
zip             6/ddp           # Zone Information Protocol
afpovertcp      548/tcp         # AFP over TCP
afpovertcp      548/udp

cp conf/atalkd.conf /usr/local/atalk/etc/
cp config/afpd.conf /usr/local/atalk/etc

cp conf/AppleVolumes.default /usr/local/atalk/etc
cp conf/AppleVolumes.system /usr/local/atalk/etc

The AppleVolumes.default and AppleVolumes.system
files are listings of volume to path mappings and
type / creator mappings. AppleVolumes.default
will be parsed when a real user logs in.
(ie: not the guest account) The settings in
AppleVolumes.default can be overridden with an
AppleVolumes or .AppleVolumes file in the users'
home directory. AppleVolumes.system will be
processed for all users. Adding the lines:

#
# volumes
Home
/music "Some Tunes"
#
# type / creator mappings
.txt    TEXT    MSWD

will cause two volumes to show up, one called Home
which is the user's home directory and one
called Some Tunes that is the directory /music. (keep
in mind that users won't be able to see the
contents of volumes unless the unix user has at least
read permission in the directory. same goes for
write permission.) The rest of the file is a listing of
"dot extensions" to type / creator mappings.

I've been doing this for awhile.  I have a stable netatalk/samba server
at netatalk 1.4b2+asun.  No trouble; unless my users aren't telling me.
Read the mailing lists - there a --with-netatalk config time option (not
in the build docs that I could see, but it was covered on the mailing
list IIRC).  --with-netatalk is currently an experimental hack, if I
remember, it forces samba to move the .AppleDouble entries if a PC user
moves files around from the PC (so as not to pooch appleshare side
stuff).  Don't know how reliable it is, I only included that option on
the most recent server I config'd and it hasn't been tested thoroughly
yet.

-----

A guest only server seemed like a good idea for security. I have two 
servers on one box. Guest is one of them. Guest is defined as such: 
"Guest" -transall -uamlist uams_guest.so -systemvol 
/etc/atalkd/AppleVolumes.guest \ 

the AppleVolumes.guest file has all of the standard mappings and then at the 
bottom has the line 
/mnt/world World 

The lines describing the AppleVolumes file says that the systemvol one 
defines the mappings and the shares available to guest... so I figured this 
should make just the share "World" available to guest. It did... however 
in the list (greyed out mind you) was another share from 
Applevolumes.default. Why would this exist as I am guest? I figrued the 
fact that it was greyed out was ok... but not the best of all worlds... So 
I created a new AppleVolumes.default file (as AppleVolumes.empty added it 
with -defaultvol option) and removed everything except the "World" share 
from the .empty file. Now I get nothing for guest! Argh!... It seems from 
reading that the only thing I should have to do for a guest volume is add it 
to the AppleVolumes.system! This is really screwy!

P.S. Anyone else get an occasional Hickup in their transfers. about every 
meg or so I see a considerable well... not slowdown... it really stops... 
and then it continues... ideas? 
#----
There are two config files looked for by etc/afpd. (AppleVolumes.system and
AppleVolumes.default) They both have the same format. The only
differience is that users coming in as guest will only get the volumes listed
in the AppleVolumes.default file. (as well as only having guest privelage)
Usually I use
AppleVolumes.system to export the directories that everyone should be able to
see such as /usr2/data and AppleVolumes.default exports private
stuff such as ~/, the home directory of the user. There are examples of each
of these files in your netatalk source directory under etc/afpd/. They are
etc.AppleVolumes.system and etc.AppleVolumes.default. You should copy these
two files into your DESTDIR/etc directory (usually
/usr/local/atalk/etc) and get rid of the etc. in front of the names. One of my
AppleVolumes.system files is below: 

/usr2/data Thak
/usr4/extra_space "Extra Space"
.txt TEXT MSWD
.TXT TEXT MSWD
.html TEXT TTXT
.HTML TEXT TTXT
.gif GIFf 8BIM
.jpg JPEG 8BIM
.jpeg JPEG 8BIM
#----
Additional 'Guest' shares (i.e. shares for users who don't have an account on
the Linux machine) can be created by just adding the shares which
       should be available to the Mac clients to
'/etc/atalk/AppleVolumes.default' (just below the '~' which makes the home
directories available):

       /tmp tmp
Pitfalls:

          1.Mac clients do not accept passwords longer than eight characters,
even if it is a password to a valid account on the Linux machine. 
#----

mkdir /var/netatalk
chmod 0777 /var/netatalk

vi afpd.conf
"Vol Name" -uamlist uams_guest.so

vi AppleVolumes.default
/var/netatalk ShareName

FOR RH7.3:
vi /etc/init.d/atalk
change to:
daemon afpd -U uams_guest.so -c ${AFPD_MAX_CLIENTS}
or else you can not have guest volumes
