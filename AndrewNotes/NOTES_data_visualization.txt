#define NCURVES 5

int     npts=NPTS;
int     irr=0,nxsub=1,nysub=1;
int     just=0,axis=1;
float   xmin=0.0,xmax=5.0,ymin=-1.0,ymax=1.0;

float   x[NPTS],y[NPTS];
int     i,j;

main ()
{
      pgbegin_(&irr,"?",&nxsub,&nysub,1L);
      pgenv_(&xmin,&xmax,&ymin,&ymax,&just,&axis);
      pglabel_("x-axis","y-axis","My first graph",6L,6L,14L);

      for (j=1; j<=NCURVES; j++) {
            for (i=0; i<NPTS; i++) {
                  x[i] = 0.1*i;
                  y[i] = sin(0.5*j*x[i])/(float)(j);
            }
            pgline_(&npts,x,y);
      }
      pgend_();
}

The function headers for the PGPLOT subroutines are defined in "pgplot.h". Because the PGPLOT subroutines are written in FORTRAN, you will need to take the
following precautions when calling PGPLOT from C: 

     Subroutine names have appended underscores (eg. pgbegin becomes pgbegin_ etc.) 
     If you define an array x[NPTS], the array index starts from 0 and runs up to NPTS-1. In FORTRAN, the index starts at 1 and runs up to NPTS. However, in
     FORTRAN, when you pass the array x as a parameter, the address of x(1) is passed, which is equivalent to the the address of x[0] in C. Thus, in the example
     above, although the index i has different ranges in the FORTRAN and C implementations, the function call 

           pgline_(&npts,x,y);

     will result in all NPTS points being plotted. 
     FORTRAN strings are handled quite differently from C strings. In C, strings are terminated by a '\0' character. In FORTRAN, strings are not terminated, but
     rather, their lengths are stored. Hence, whenever you pass a string from C to FORTRAN, you need to pass its length as well. Note that the length is a longint, and
     a longint must be passed, otherwise you will get data alignment errors. The standard library function strlen() from <stdlib.h> is often useful. For
     example, to pass the variables char* xlabel,ylabel,toplabel to pglabel, use: 

           pglabel_(xlabel,ylabel,toplabel,
              (long)strlen(xlabel),(long)strlen(ylabel),(long)strlen(toplabel));

     In FORTRAN, all parameters for function calls are passed by reference, hence instead of just calling 

           pgbegin_(irr,"?",nxsub,nysub,1L),

     you must pass the addresses of the variables, hence 

           pgbegin_(&irr,"?",&nxsub,&nysub,1L).

     Note that #define's are handled by the pre-processor and therefore, do not actually define a variable with an address in the computer's memory. In the above
     example, 

           pgline(&NPTS,x,y);

     will not work, nor will 

           pgline(&51,x,y);

     You will have to define a variable for each parameter that you wish to pass to PGPLOT. Note also that because x and y are defined as pointers (ie. addresses in
     memory), they are passed as is, not as &x and &y. Strings may also be passed as is, because they are stored as type char *.

PDL (perl data language) and PGPLOT

    # ensure the module is loaded (required for PDL versions >= 2.004)
    use PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT;
    # The size of the window can be specified
    $ENV{PGPLOT_XW_WIDTH}=0.3;
    # You can set your device explicitly
    dev($^O =~ /MSWin32/ ? '/GW' : '/XSERVE');

    # First we define some variables to use for the rest of the demo.
    $x=sequence(10);
    $y=2*$x**2;

    # Now a simple plot with points
    points $x, $y;
    # Here is the same with lines
    line $x, $y;

    # If you want to overlay one plot you can use the command
    # 'hold' to put the graphics on hold and 'release' to
    # revert the effect

    points $x, $y, {SYMBOL=>4};  # The last argument sets symboltype
    hold;
    # Now draw lines between the points
    line $x, $y;
    # Plot errorbars over the points
    $yerr=sqrt($y);
    errb $x, $y, $yerr;

    # To revert to old behaviour, use release
    release;

    # To change plot specifics you can either use the specific PGPLOT
    # commands - recommended if you need lots of control over your
    # plot.
    #
    # Or you can use the new option specifications:

    # To plot our first graph again with blue color, dashed line
    # and a thickness of 10 we can do:

    line $x, $y, {COLOR=>5, LINESTYLE=>'dashed', LINEWIDTH=>10};

  #
  # More examples of changing the plot defaults
  # 
  $a = 1+sequence(10);
  $b = $a*2;
  $bord_opt = { TYPE => 'RELATIVE', VALUE => 0.1 };
  line log10($a), $b, { AXIS => 'LOGX', BORDER => $bord_opt };

Hi,

I've written a perl module interface to a graphics package called vis5d.

http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/vis5d.html

vis5d is a package for visualization of scientific data primarly
developed for and used by the atmospheric sciences community.  Anyway,
I've been working on this module for several months now and think that
it's about ready to add to the perl archive. I've discussed it
publically only on a vis5d mailing list where I haven't found any perl
programmers, so the interest level may be pretty low at least
initially.   I thought it should go in the archive as Graphics::Vis5d

 Subject: Scientific Graphics Library for live graphics 
 Newsgroups: comp.os.linux.misc
 Date: 2000/02/04 


Hi,

I am searching for a graphics/plot library with the following
features:

- plots and diagrams, similar in functionality to gnuplot, or matlab,
or maple graphics

- has to support 2D and 3D graphics

- should have C bindings, if possible also C++, Modula-3, java or
phyton (I will likely programn most of my processing in Modula-3 which
seems to be a pretty cool modern language for engineering). I
acknowledge that phyton is cool also but it has to be fast.

- able to update data constantly (will say, I give the Library a float
buffer and possibly a mutex and say to it: "Hey, this is a 2 x 256
Array of data. I want you to display that every 0.1 sec in a mesh
plot, and you should use logarithmic axis and set the upper limit to
10 and the lower limit to zero.")

- fast (I need to display data from real-time audio-processing)


- it has to run on the alpha CPU platform


the following points are welcomed but not required :

- As I need to publish and present my work I would like to generate
printable output. The nonplusultra would be a print dialog which lets
me generate Postscript Files with TeX fonts. It would be also pretty
nice if it could generate PNG graphics for my web sites and Windows
CGM files for my windozed coworker.

- I want to size and change Windows at run-time

- I would be really happy if I could have a graphics-control
commandline while the thing is running so that I could say: "Oh no,
the lower limit should be -2.0. Remember that!"


- As I will have lots of windows it would be nice to support some sort
of Window managment (perhaps remembering position or so).


- It would be nice if I could save data to an ASCII file.
  
- it doesn't has to be Open Source but it should be very reliable and
suitable for long term projects.


I have found various items in the SAL Library (SAL-Archiv
http://SAL.KachinaTech.COM/index.shtml), but I don't have experience
with any lib/program except gnuplot.
