INSTALLING THEMES

Sawfish themes
For these themes, you need to use a terminal to
change directory to ~/.sawfish/themes then run
"tar zxf" on you theme. For example, for
Sawfish-gorilla.tar.gz you need to do the following:

cd ~/.sawfish/themes
tar zxf <path-to>/Sawfish-gorilla.tar.gz

of course you need to specify <path-to> as the
directory where you downloaded Sawfish-gorilla.tar.gz
to. Then all you need to do is open up the Gnome Control
Center, goto the Sawfish Appearance page, and select
it from the dropdown list.

GTK themes
GTK themes should be a lot easier to install, just a case of
clicking the Install new theme... button in the Theme
Selector page of the Control Center and selecting the theme
file you downloaded.
If this fails to make the theme appear in the list of
Available themes, try using the terminal again to change
directory to ~/.themes and run tar to unpack your theme
there. For example, for the America theme:

cd ~/.themes
tar zxf <path-to>/America.tar.gz

Again replacing <path-to> with the actual path to the downloaded file.

You can of course use a gui program like file-roller to
unpack your themes to the directory if you want. Basicly,
sawfish themes need to be unpacked to ~/.sawfish and gtk
themes to ~/.themes

Nautilus Themes
Basicly all you need to do is extract your Nautilus theme
(tar zxf ) then in a Nautilus window, goto "Preferences"
and click on "Edit Preferences...". In the window that
appears, click on "Appearance" in the list on the left
hand side of the window. Click the "Add New Theme..."
button and select the directory where the theme you just
extracted placed itself. This copies the theme to
~/.nautilus/themes so you can now delete the extracted
files/directories. Your new theme should now appear in
the "Nautilus Themes" list (above the "Add New Theme..." button). 

GDM Greeter themes
tar tzvf gdm_greeter_theme.tar.gz
should show a single directory, like "circles/"
untar into /usr/share/gdm/themes/

also gdmsetup has a "Install new theme" that will
do the same thing (from a tar.gz or tgz file)
