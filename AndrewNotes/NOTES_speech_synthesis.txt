 And the best I have found so far is Festival with Mbrola voices (although not
perfect they are far superior than the Festival voices)

#--
 I can only concur with the poster above who said that Festival with MBrola is
probably the bet OSS bet. Actually, The MBrola voice itself has a license for
"non-commercial" use, but we are a nonprofit, so...
In particular, there is one high-res female voice in MBrola that is very good.
If you need any help setting it up (I can happiyl give you my festival config
file) just say mail me at netgrok @at@ yahoo . de 
    * There is a small script that checks the main services on all our
    * critical machines and if one goes down, the system moans. A loud voice
    * that says "The http server on web1 is down" gets more attention than a
    * little light.
    * Our backup system moans at specific times (about three times a day)
    * about the next tape that needs to be put in. "Please insert the correct
    * tape into the tape drive on backup. The tape needed is Unix 1.

      The backup will start at 4 this afternoon" is the announcement I just
heard. Sometimes I add "Please insert the tape, pleeeeease", just to hear the
damn computer beg ME for a change :)

Also, if I FORGET to insert the tape the computer starts moaning continously
about it. Nothing like a whining b.tch to convince you get off your butt to
put the tape in :)

festival is included with RH now.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
festival --tts /etc/redhat-release
sounds like a chipmunk. Do this:
vi /usr/share/festival/siteinit.scm
#--
(Parameter.set 'Audio_Method 'Audio_Command)
(Parameter.set 'Audio_Required_Rate 48000)
(Parameter.set 'Audio_Required_Format 'snd)
(Parameter.set 'Audio_Command "play $FILE")
#--
this happens with VIA audio chipsets

change voice with
festival
>(voice_ked_diphone)
>(tts "/etc/redhat-release" nil)

other voices on RH (stick voice_ at beginning) #errors if not found
kal_diphone  #default
ked_diphone
el_diphone

MBROLA voices go under
ls /usr/share/festival/voices/english/
kal_diphone  ked_diphone  us1_mbrola


You can make festival read text kernel docs to you with:
cd /usr/src/linux/Documentation
for f in *.txt
do	festival --tts $f
done

to run examples (not included in RH)
festival --script ./saytime.sh
