ok - so i really need to get a prism2 driver and use that by hand

    * Unpack pcmcia-cs-3.1.?.tar.gz in /usr/src.
     * Run ``make config'' in the new pcmcia-cs-3.1.? directory.
     * Run ``make all'', then ``make install''.
     * Customize the startup script and the option files in /etc/pcmcia 
for your site, if needed.

Have you done the first couple steps?  There should be an /etc/pcmcia if 
you have unpacked the tar file and done make config; make all; make install.

i assume you're talking about the D-Link DWL-650? i'm running the latest
Red Hat 7.2 beta and using these cards, along with a functional equivalent
card, the Linksys WPC11...

the purported 'best' solution is to use the orinoco_cs and hermes drivers;
however, i have not had success... here' what works for me (and perfectly,
too, i might add):

- download the latest pcmcia-cs package... untar, make config and
make install... the driver you want is wvlan_cs.o... the module is not
'perfectly' suited for the card, but loads, reports 'ok, i'll try to make
this work' (use dmesg to see output after popping the card in)...

- you can then use the 'normal' wireless utilties to configure the card...
for example, here's a short script i use in an IBM StinkPad 390X to set up
wireless service (i don't use encryption, mind you) to forward packets
from the LAN to a wireless subnet (i'm posting this from an IBM Z50
WorkPad running NetBSD, which also uses the D-Link card):

# take down eth0 (wired to the LAN)
ifconfig eth0 down
# now bring it up
ifconfig eth0 yourlaptophostname up
# now set the default LAN gateway
route add default gw yourgateway
# take down eth1 (the D-Link card)
ifconfig eth1 down
# now configure the card
iwconfig eth1 essid "YOURNETNAME" 
iwconfig eth1 mode Ad-hoc 
iwconfig eth1 rate 11M
# display the settings
iwconfig eth1
# now configure the card to the below IP
ifconfig eth1 192.168.1.4 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
# now ensure IP forwarding is enabled, then do it
/etc/rc.d/init.d/ipchains start
echo 1 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j MASQ 

this works great for me...

BTW, the D-Link DWL-650 is a great card to modify for an external antenna
connection... i just built a 2.4Ghz vertical collinear omnidirectional
antenna for $10 last friday, modified the card, and then doubled the range
of the card... see:

Skyline PC Card, wvlan_cs
The clue to the problem came from carefully watching the boot messages. That showed Red
                             Hat Linux 7.2 was trying to start the wireless PC Card, Eth 0, before it started the PCMCIA
                             services. Thus, the Linux operating system (OS) could not see the Skyline PC Card when it
                             wanted to start Eth 0.

open the /etc/init.d/pcmcia startup-script
 chkconfig: 2345 45 96
TO
chkconfig: 2345 09 96

The Proxim Skyline 802.11b PC Card for Notebooks
                             uses the Intersil (previously Harris Semiconductor) Prism2
                             chip

http://www.goonda.org/wireless/prism2/
With the release of the 0.1.10 drivers, its no longer necessary to patch
0.1.8-pre13 with newsham's patches to get promiscuous mode support
you can enable monitor mode on channel 11, for example, by doing the
following:

wlanctl-ng wlan0 lnxreq_wlansniff channel=11 enable=true

If successful, you should see a message like:

message=lnxreq_wlansniff
  enable=true
  channel=11
  resultcode=success


If you get a resultcode=no_value, then something is wrong. Once you have got
this working, you can then run prismdump to capture packets on the wlan0
interface.

WEP (encryption)

I have been able to use both 64 and 128-bit WEP to talk to a SMC2652W AP with
no problems. I haven't yet figured out if I can set the value using wlancfg, I
simply edited
the /etc/pcmcia/wlan-ng.opts file to reflect my desired SSID, and WepKeys.


http://www.glue.umd.edu/~chus/dosattack.html

http://www.natecarlson.com/include/showpage.php?cat=linux&page=wireless-sniff
To put the card into monitor mode (note: this WILL make the network card
unusable for normal traffic!), run the following command:

         wlanctl-ng wlan0 lnxreq_wlansniff channel=N enable=true

         Generally, you'll want to sniff on Channel 6 (it's the default, and
most people don't change the default), but you may want to play with other
channels, too. To
         stop sniffing, run the same thing, except enable=false.

         Once you have the card in sniffing mode, you can use prismdump to
dump some packets out into a pcap-format file. This is really simple; just
run:

         prismdump > sniff.out

         I generally also run airsnort's capture with the '-c' flag while I am
doing this; that way, I can see how many packets have gone through. This file
will grow,
         quick. Once it starts growing, it means you have some data!

         Final Step: Analyze the packets!


         Well, now that you have some packets saved to disk, I suppose you
want to view them, huh? If all you want is the ESSID, and you don't care about
anything
         else, you can just dump the packets with tcpdump:

         tcpdump -X -x -r sniff.out


http://creatis-www.insa-lyon.fr/~bellet/creatis/wlan/wireless.html
You can switch to promiscuous mode :

wlanctl-ng  wlan0 lnxreq_wlansniff channel=10 enable=true
