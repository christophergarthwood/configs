to stop X from listening on tcp:

X -nolisten tcp

so if gdm is your login manager
vi /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf
change
[servers]
0=/usr/bin/X11/X
TO
[servers]
0=/usr/bin/X11/X -nolisten tcp


for command-line X
vi /usr/bin/X11/startx
change
serverargs=""
to
serverargs="-nolisten tcp"

a better way is to stick something in
/etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc
but I'm not sure what

SSH  x-forwarding STILL WORKS RIGHT!!!!

xhost +local:

ssh-agent setup

2 files: .xinitrc and .xsession in ~
.xinitrc gets used under run level 5 (xdm/gdm/...)
.xsession gets used when startx is run from runlevel 3 (CLI)

both can be the same:
vi .xinitc
#---
exec ssh-agent gnome-session
#---

change gnome-session to blackbox for blackbox, etc...

#----------------------------------

For a dumb Xterminal

make default runlevel 5

if xdm is display manager:
vi /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers
change
:0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X
to
:0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X -query SERVER1

where SERVER1 is the server that allows XDMCP requests

#--
For a normal machine running with a local desktop, etc +
  remote Xsessions:
start your normal desktop
alt+ctrl+F2 for vt2, login in, then:
/usr/X11R6/bin/X :1 -query SERVER1

This XSession starts in vt8 (alt+ctrl+F8).
On some wm's (gnome), F8 is taken, so do a
alt+ctrl+F1 to go to vt1 then go to vt7 or vt8

#--
Xnest (in X 4.x + ) is great for this to:
in your normal Xsession in an xterm:
Xnest :2 -query 192.168.0.234 #defaults to 3/4 screen
Xnest :1 -query trillian -geometry 1024x768
#or leave a little room for the xwindow border
Xnest :1 -query trillian -geometry 1010x740

xnest is fairly unstable and will die on semi-normal key shortcuts,etc

FOR A BIG BOX TO SERVICE XDMCP

XDM
> You can run xdm without X? When I start xdm, there is an X server running.
> Which happens to be fine for what I need.

Canonical Linux/xdm setup is that way: :0 is mentioned in the Xservers
file and xdm starts it up. X-terminals have their own X server and use
XDMCP to announce themselves to xdm and have it start managing them.
Example Xservers entries:

# Local server, xdm must start it before connecting
:0              local   /usr/X11R6/bin/X :0 -bpp 16

# Foreign server on an X-terminal, xdm merely connects to it
talbot:0        foreign
talbot:1        foreign
jupiter:0       foreign

The foreign entries are only needed for X-terminals that don't support
XDMCP, those that do will get the login box automatically if they are
allowed access in the Xaccess file.

GDM
vi /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf
change
[servers]
0=/usr/bin/X11/X
to
[servers]
#0=/usr/bin/X11/X

Redhat 6.2

Then  xdm runs the Xsession script as the user.  This system session file may do some additional
       startup and typically runs the .xsession script in the user's home directory.  When the Xsession
       script exits, the session is over.

SCRAWL FONT:
scrawl_s and scrawl_w are included in the game lincity:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lincity
in the ./opening directory

I can't tell a difference between the two.
To put it into your systemwide console fonts (in RH):
Gzip scrawl_s.fnt and (as root)
cp scrawl_s.fnt.gz /lib/kbd/consolefonts
chmod 0644 /lib/kbd/consolefonts/scrawl_s.fnt.gz

to get a quick test, type (as user):
setfont scrawl_s

In RH9, login or something close to it sets the font back to the default system font.

In RH9, to change the default system font:
vi /etc/sysconfig/i18n
SYSFONT="scrawl_s"

TO use a console fnt in X:

I didn't try yours but I did this to get mine going. It should be the same process. I used a
bdf file instead a pcf since I can see what foundry, family etc is in the file. I used fontedit
to turn the fnt file to a bdf file. I looked inside your pcf and could not find out what foundry,
family it was using...

cp scrawl_s.bdf.gz /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc
cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/misc

less scrawl_s.bdf.gz
#---
...
FONT "-Console-scrawl_s-Medium-R-Normal--16-120-100-100-C-80-ISO8859-1"
...
#---
vi fonts.alias
#---
scrawl_s     -Console-scrawl_s-Medium-R-Normal--16-120-100-100-C-80-ISO8859-1
#---

#reload fonts
xset fp rehash   #I actually just restart X here instead

now this should show up in xfontsel with foundry: console, family: scrawl_s
hit select, go to an xterm, hold control and right mouse button, hit "selection" and
the font should turn to scrawl.

To put it as a default:
vi ~/.Xdefaults
#--
#XTerm*font: -console-scrawl_s-medium-r-normal-*-12-120-75-75-c-*-iso8859-1
XTerm*font: -console-scrawl_s-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-100-*-c-*-iso8859-1
#--

The first one is small and hard to see, but the uncommented one is nice.

I realized there are about 1000 programs called fontedit:
